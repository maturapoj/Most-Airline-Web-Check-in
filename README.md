## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed.

### 2. Installation
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd my-check-in
bun install
```

### 3. Development
Run the development server:
```bash
bun run dev
```
Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Use **HUUM** and **ABC123** to bypass validation.

## 🐳 Docker Support

The application is fully containerized for consistent deployment.

### Using Docker Compose
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Using Docker
```bash
docker build -t airline-checkin .
docker run -p 3000:3000 airline-checkin
```

## 🌙 Technical Highlights

### 🛡️ Step Guard & Route Protection
The application utilizes a custom `StepGuard` component that monitors the user's progress. It prevents manual URL entry into later steps (e.g., trying to access `/boarding-pass` directly) and redirects users to their furthest qualified step.

### ⏳ Simulated API & Loading Logic
To provide a realistic user experience, `async` loading states and artificial delays are implemented across the flow, ensuring that the interface provides clear feedback during transitions.

### 🎨 Tailwind v4 Dark Mode
The system implements a manual theme toggle using a custom Tailwind v4 variant. This allows for precise control over the dark mode transition without relying strictly on system preferences.

```css
/* globals.css */
@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));
```
